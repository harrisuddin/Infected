# Infected

Infected is a simple MMOG where the infected have to chase the humans and turn them into infected.

                                                          Game Plan

The game is going to be similar to a tag game where there will be one player that is infected that will go around chasing the other players, if the infected player touches another player then that player will become infected, Once a player gets infected they join the infected side and try to get the other non infected players. 

There will be a lobby of players and one player will be randomly chosen to be the be the infected player, all the player will spawn i the same map and the infected player will spawn in the middle of the map while all the non infected players will spawn around the edges of the map.

Each round will last two minutes or until every single player is infected,
Each round will be out of 10 players, 1 infected and 9 non infected, we might expand the game to have different sizes of lobbies in the future. There will be a point system, every second that you survive as a non infected they will get a point, the infected player will gain 10 points per each person they get infected.

The map will be free roam with small obstacles in the map
